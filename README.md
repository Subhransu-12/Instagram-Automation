response times on the graph are drastically different because of network speed variation as per ISP or slow process of individual's computer.
Correct
The google speed test is a flaky test itself and sometimes fails to return a proper response. These failures are eventually taken into account by our own test which can cause the test to end later than a successful test would end.

Question 6
How could you make our performance test of the google speed test more robust such that it recognizes failures of the software under test faster?

1 / 1 point
performance test of the google speed test can be made more robust by testing the application output,processing speest memory utilization Command response time and network bandwidth .
